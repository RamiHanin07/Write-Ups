Sometimes a web service will have hidden files or directories on their web server that GoBuster can sometimes find.


GoBuster is a versatile tool that allows for performing DNS, vhost, and directory brute-forcing. The tool has additional functionality, such as enumeration of public AWS S3 buckets


Example: gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.121/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
