Pentesting tool with many built in exploits and helps you use them.

Also does a bunch of other shit:
Running reconnaissance scripts to enumerate remote hosts and compromised targets

Verification scripts to test the existence of a vulnerability without actually compromising the target

Meterpreter, which is a great tool to connect to shells and run commands on the compromised targets

Many post-exploitation and pivoting tools



Open: msfconsole


can search for a particular exploit by using:

"search [exploit]"


copy the result and then you can USE the exploit with:

"use [path you found above]"

before you can run it, you need to configure: 

"show options" and fill in al the "required" options.
    - RHOSTS: IP of target (single IP, multiple IPs, or a list of IPs) - "set RHOSTS [ip]"
    - LHOSTS: IP of attacker, tun0 interface - "set LHOSTS tun0"


Before you hit the server, you can check to see if it's vulnerable:

"exploit([path found above]) > check"

noteverything will be "checkable", but worth trying.

Finally, you can run exploit with:

"exploit([path found above]) > exploit"
